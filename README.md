  AN ANCIENT GREEK AND ETHIOPIA THEMED PORTFOLIO PROJECT

  this is project is written in a shuffled order to make the reader more interested and to ignite a spark of curiousity, the styles used in this project are pure css styles

  i referenced the figma design i did so thats why the names are quite weird and hard to recognize, but  when i was working on this website i wanted to know which went in to which inorder to reference it again when needed and fix any bugs.
